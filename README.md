# Personal Finance Dashboard-PBI
This repository contains the the visualization of personal finance which I built on Power BI.
## What I want ?
1. What is my net worth?
2. How my expenses are increasing/decreasing over the years.
3. How my savings are going up/down over the years?
4. How my salary increment affecting my expenses and savings.
5. Where am I spending the most?
6. How am I saving the most?
## Dataset
I have used the excel file to create this dashboard. 
## Conclusion
I have created multiple KPIs to see the performance over the years and have added the tooltips to see the trend of my expenses and savings. By looking at all the trends and data I came to know that my expenses are increasing while saving is decreasing despite the increment in my salary. i need to take appropriate decion to control my expenses and need to focus on my savings.
## Credits
